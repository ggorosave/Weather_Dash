# 06 Weather Dashboard

## Description

There are some many reasons why someone might need to check the weather forecast, and The Weather Dashboard is meant help the user find the current and five-day forcast of a given city. This application takes a user input and searches through external data to return the forecast. Buttons that display previously searced cities and the elements that show the five day forecast are dynamically rendered with JavaScript. In this project, I utilized some Bootstrap, but implement some custom styling also. I chose to write vanilla JavaScript for this project because I wanted more practice and to get a firmer understanding of it. I used the [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/) API to retrieve the external data for the weather.
